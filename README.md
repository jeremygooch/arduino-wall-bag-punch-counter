## Synopsis

This is a simple push button counter for an arduino using a 7 segment LED display. I've fitted the device to a plate of oak wood and setup a triggering mechanism using a series of bolts and springs to protect the small push button against heavy force. The purpose of the device is to brace a Wing Chun wallbag while counting the number of punches a practicioner takes on the wallbag. This way the practicioner can focus on technique, structure, speed and power without having to keep count of how many punches they performed. 

The device can be seen in action here at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qOy_Nl3tbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qOy_Nl3tbE)

## Code

The code is quite simple using standard [arduino code](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/StyleGuide) syntax.

## Motivation

Often practicioners like to keep count of their punches to improve the number of sets they can do and counting while trying to focus on punching technique can cause frustration and divide focus. This code is part of a device to handle the mundane task of counting punches.
